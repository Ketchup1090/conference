#===[ TODOs ]===========================================================

NOW
o can_edit?, should have setting to determine if allowed to edit after deadline
o proposal_statuses?, should have setting to determine if these can be set/published

SOON
o proposals#_form: hide speaker manager behind toggle, replacing search with "Add another speaker..."
o proposals#_form: "more" links need popup icon

LATER
o Public comments, add
o record-controls, add them at top in addition to bottom of page
o autoresize textareas, us it for snippets, events and proposals

MAYBE
o state_change_select: rework it so that it's "Status|Change this proposal's status from 'Accepted' to [- no change-]". rework it as a partial?
o Snippets, extract into plugin?
o cache-money, replace the LookupMixin?
o sluggable_finder, replace custom slugging?
