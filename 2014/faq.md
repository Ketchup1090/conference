FAQ

* Are only conference tickets (without accomodation) available?

    Yes. However, due the conference logistics there will only be a few avaiable later in Feb depending on how other tickets get sold. These tickets will not be refundable or transferrable. So, we recommend staying at the hotel and adding the Goan spirit. 

* Why are there no early-bird tickets? Will tickets rate change?

    We have only early-rooms. Since this conference is with accomodation, we may have to limit attendees. So, the early bird gets the room. We are going to try our best not to change rates. However, if the demand is more than we can manage, rates may increase. Oh! Did you mean, decrease in rates? Nah! This is probably the best deal you can find in Goa in March.

* When is the conference party?

    This year, we are having a mid-conference beach party on Saturday, 22nd. So *everyone* is welcome to attend. Details of the party will updated later in Jan - Do not miss it, it's going to be a blast!

* Considering the same-gender policy, can couples share the same room? 

    Yes, of course, we're not tyrants. :) However, please let us know in advance by sending an email to stay@rubyconfindia.org. Please note, this is applicable only for Deluxe and Supreme tickets. Lite pass is strictly on same-gender basis.

* For an extended stay, do we get some discounted rates?

    Yes! LaLiT has been kind enough to offer the discounted rates of Rs. 9,500 per night for an 'All Meals' plan for 2 nights before and after the conference. So, stick around if you can. Please remember to tell the hotel staff at the time of check-in about your extended stay.

* For a supereme ticket, what about other people staying but not attending the conference?

    All rooms are twin-occupancy. So, if you bring along your family who has no idea about Ruby and is not attending the conference, all their meals are included in the stay. Children below 8 years are not charged. Extra person incurs charges of Rs. 4,000 per night. Note: This is applicable ONLY for Supreme tickets, not Deluxe and Lite.

* What are check-in and check-out times?

    You need to check-in on Friday 21st after 14:00 hrs and checkout on Sunday, 23rd by 11:00 hrs. Early check-in or late check-out may be subject to additional charges.
