                    <span class="speaker_name">by Bhavin Javia</span> <span class="toggleImage">&nbsp;</span> <span class="details" style="display:none;">Quality is one of the most important factors in deriving business value from software. However, many teams find it difficult to incorporate the appropriate quality and testing practices into their development processes. A test strategy helps create a shared understanding of what testing will be required, and how and when it will be executed.<br />
                    <br />
                    The Ruby and Rails communities have embraced testing and code quality as core values, and a rich ecosystem of tools has developed. Despite this support, many developers and teams overlook the creation of a test strategy as it is thought to be an unnecessary overhead that is traditionally associated with formal/waterfall style development methodologies. However, a well developed Test Strategy can be the difference between great software and a maintenance nightmare.<br />
                    <br />
                    This presentation will explain the process of defining quality (internal and external) for Ruby and Rails applications including metrics and targets. It will then explain the process for creating and executing a Test Strategy that ensures the intended quality objectives are achieved. Additionally, it will explain how to align a Test Strategy with the typical practices of a team using Agile or Lean methods.<br />

But what about the last ten percent? Every app has to jump off the Rails eventually, whether that means integrating with an external web service, importing data from another database, or providing enhanced search functionality. In this talk I'll lead you through some patterns for handling those cases, and discuss certain features of Rails 3 that let you leverage the best pieces of the core framework without resorting to ugly hacks. Finally we'll discuss what a new, more modular core framework means for a post-Rails world.</span>

Their job was to quickly write mission critical Rails applications, and they practiced various aspects of Continuous Delivery. Over the duration of this project, they noticed the evolution of interesting patterns that were thought to be great ideas. Many were, some weren't.<br />
                    <br />
                    Chiku and Habib will be pair-presenting their learnings in a way that mirrors the eternal tussle that a developer faces daily - convenience versus quality. One of them will assume the role of a devil and persuasively present a code-fragment that mirrored one such anti-pattern. The other will then take over as an angel and explain the problem inherent in that code-fragment, and proceed to clean it up. They will then swap roles and proceed to the next point.<br />
                    <br />
                    At the end of this presentation the audience will have the knowledge of identifying and subsequently fixing similar manifestations of these problems in their code.</span>

                  </dt>
                  <dt>
                    <span class="speaker_name">by Janmejay Singh and Pavan K Sudarshan</span> <span class="toggleImage">&nbsp;</span> <span class="details" style="display:none;"><a href="http://test-load-balancer.github.com/">Test Load Balancer (TLB)</a> is a tool that can automatically partition tests into multiple subsets, each one of which can be executed in parallel. The execution can happen on different physical/virtual machines or on the same machine as different processes or threads. The more the partitions, the less the number of tests executed on each one, and since all of the partitions start at the same time (and finish almost at the same time) overall test-execution time gets divided by the number of partitions you make. Test-running is by far the longest step in most (if not all) builds, and cutting down test-running time speeds up the build and hence the feedback loop. TLB can be used for any kind of test-suite - unit, integration or functional tests.<br />
                    <br />
                    In addition to balancing, TLB does other interesting things like re-order tests within a subset (set of tests that run on a partition) before they are executed. For instance, it re-arranges tests to execute failing ones (that failed in the previous build) first, hence ensuring early feedback.<br />
                    <br />
                    Most build servers (like Hudson, Go, TeamCity, Bamboo, etc.) and even tools like capistrano/cluster-ssh provide parallel execution capability (capability to execute command(s) on different machines at the same time). However, parallelization of tests needs a tool that can decide what tests need to be run in each such parallely running process across machines. This is where TLB comes in.<br />
                    <br />
                    This talk will introduce the audience to TLB concepts and include a demo of using TLB to partition RSpec and Test::Unit suites. It'll also include a case-study on how TLB helped cut build time from approximately 70 minutes to 11 minutes (which can of course be further reduced) just by throwing more hardware at it.</span>

                  </dt>
                  <dt>
                    <span class="speaker_name">by Karthik Sirasanagandla</span> <span class="toggleImage">&nbsp;</span> <span class="details" style="display:none;">By personal experience, while transitioning from the world of Java to the world of Ruby, I felt great pain and agony, whenever I read statements like "Everything in Ruby is an object; classes themselves are objects". It took me more than a while to get it all right. I am of the belief that the experience is the same for many who transitioned to the Ruby platform. If you didn't experience this...lucky you! My reason for this experience is that during the early days of learning Ruby, I felt that the Ruby Object Model is some advanced topic as it is comes under Ruby Meta-programming, and that I can do away with it until I'm more than an intermediate level Ruby developer. In reality, though, any decent programming in Ruby meant understanding rightly - the Ruby Object Model. Understanding the Ruby Object Model helps not just in learning Meta-programming, but also improves code design with enriched knowledge and appreciations of the object model.<br />
                    <br />
                    In my presentation, I intend to talk about the Ruby Object Model, elaborating on the concepts of visualizing classes and objects in Ruby, how they are different from Java, method look-ups in Ruby, class/static methods in Java/C# vs. the ones in Ruby, mixins over inheritence and composition etc. All these concepts will be communicated by means of code snippets and no-nonsense visuals (object-like diagrams).</span>

We'll discuss and demonstrate three possible approaches, allowing for a minimal, medium, and large amount of reorganisation to an existing project. Each approach will build upon the previous one, showing developers how they can take an incremental approach to introducing Ruby into an existing Java environment to increase development productivity.</span>

However, if you want to build complex single page web applications like Gmail or Mobile Me, you need something more than jQuery. Keeping track of DOM elements to be updated in response to a particular action or result of an ajax query can become overwhelming very fast.<br />
                    <br />
                    Frameworks like Sproutcore, Cappuccino and Backbone.js provide structure to your javascript code. Backbone supplies structure to JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models with key-value binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable functions and views with declarative event handling.<br />
                    <br />
                    In this talk, we will go over building a simple Backbone.js application with Ruby on Rails backend and discuss some tricks and techniques that I have discovered while building supportbee.com. The outline of the talk is:<br />

While most such conversations are productive and useful, a fair portion degenerate into angry brawls. A pattern we've observed in the latter situation is that a surprising number of times the argument is that, "Why shouldn't I use language feature X to achieve objective Y- after all, the language supports X."<br />

It provides many abstractions that simplify the language, and a few syntax niceties that make it much less noisy than pure javascript. We'll cover the basic syntax and how it differs from regular javascript, and see some examples. Moreover, Rails 3.1 will ship with CoffeeScript by default, so this is a great time to get up to speed with it!</span>

But writing a compiler from scratch is often a daunting step for a fledgling programmer. Yet, compilers are useful little things that extend our craft in surprising ways. Ruby provides wonderfully accessible libraries to dive into compiler construction and the talk will focus on one of them: Treetop<br />
                    <br />
                    The talk will detail the construction of a simple filter language and using Treetop to parse grammar and interpret it, and then make it work. Treetop makes it very simple and intuitive to add new operators and new syntax, and the talk will walk through the addition of a new operator to the language. Towards the end, a simple cross-compiler will be discussed that translates our filter language into fast C.</span>

This step brought in a makeover in the way the development team functioned as well as the way the operations performed their job.<br />
                    <br />
                    I would love to share my experience when the development teams embraced Ruby and Rails. The dev teams imbibed and personified the DRY concept by building and institutionalizing enterprise wide gems and plug-ins such as LDAP Management, Single Sign On, Authentication and Authorization, Usage Tracking. The team created an app that allows bootstrapping a new ruby application with enterprise specific plug-ins, configuring Continuous Integration, and deploying to shared dev box in minutes. The dev teams got hooked on to the engineering practices such as automation testing, automated deployments utilizing the power of Rails framework and components such as Capistrano. The adoption of Ruby truly changed the thinking and functioning of the dev teams.<br />
                    <br />
                    I would also like to talk about how the operations teams opened their world to open source, specifically Ruby. After the initial resistance to open source, the Ops teams now love the Ruby and Rails infrastructure. Ruby gives them immense opportunity to maximise automation, monitoring and management of applications. The Ops team is now inching towards one click deployment of applications across environments, surely a dream come true in any enterprise.</span>

In this talk, I'll explain how to implement a high-quality rapid build and deploy process using standard CI tools, Bundler, RVM, and Capistrano. I'll also discuss how to coach your developers, QAs, and client to be "production-ready, any time."</span>

                    The first part of the talk will walk the audience through the basic features of Redis, starting from the installation to the supported data structures and the simple command set to manipulate them along with some stats related to them. Through its Ruby port Redis-rb, Redis datatypes resemble datatypes of Ruby, which makes it very natural to the Ruby programmer to use it. The simplicity and the power of Redis with Ruby will be discussed in this part. This will include a parallel hands-on session depicting operations and snippets.<br />
                    <br />
                    The second part of the talk will cover some real world use cases. Places where Redis with Ruby is used successfully and places where Redis can win. Detailed review of a few libs/apps built around Redis. Benchmarks, master-slave replication and Redis-cluster will be discussed. And finally, places where Redis is not a good fit.<br />

On the publishing front, the Rails framework is an attractive option because it supports publishing what are popularly (but inaccurately) referred to as 'RESTful' APIs quickly and effortlessly. On the consumer side, the Ruby ecosystem provides several very fluent and powerful libraries that make it easy to consume HTTP based APIs.<br />
                    <br />
