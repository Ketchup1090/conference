              </div>
              <div class="talk_description">
                Quality is one of the most important factors in deriving business value from software. However, many teams find it difficult to incorporate the appropriate quality and testing practices into their development processes. A test strategy helps create a shared understanding of what testing will be required and how and when it will be executed.<br />
                <br />
                The Ruby and Rails communities have embraced testing and code quality as core values and a rich ecosystem of tools has developed. Despite this support, many developers and teams overlook the creation of a test strategy as it is thought to be an unnecessary overhead that is traditionally associated with formal/waterfall style development methodologies. However, a well developed Test Strategy can be the difference between great software and a maintenance nightmare.<br />
                <br />
                This presentation will explain the process of defining quality (internal and external) for Ruby and Rails applications including metrics and targets. It will then explain the process for creating and executing a Test Strategy that ensures the intended quality objectives are achieved. Additionally, it will explain how to align a Test Strategy with the typical practices of a team using Agile or Lean methods.<br />

              <div class="talk_description">
                Ruby on Rails is a famously opinionated framework that handles ninety percent of the problems a typical web application faces. But what about the last ten percent? Every app has to jump off the Rails eventually, whether that means integrating with an external web service, importing data from another database, or providing enhanced search functionality. In this talk I'll lead you through some patterns for handling those cases, and discuss certain features of Rails 3 that let you leverage the best pieces of the core framework without resorting to ugly hacks. Finally we'll discuss what a new, more modular core framework means for a post-Rails world.

              </div>
              <div class="talk_description">
                The presenters, Chiku and Habib, were team members on an distributed Agile Software project. Their job was to quickly write mission critical Rails applications and they practiced various aspects of Continuous Delivery. Over the duration of this project they noticed the evolution of interesting patterns that were thought to be great ideas. Many were, some weren't.<br />
                <br />
                Chiku and Habib will be pair-presenting their learnings in a way that mirrors the eternal tussle that a developer faces daily - convenience versus quality. One of them would assume the role of a devil and persuasively present a code-fragment that mirrored one such anti-pattern. The other would then take over as an angel and explain the problem inherent in that code-fragment and would proceed to clean it up. They would then swap roles and proceed to the next point.<br />
                <br />
                At the end of this presentation the audience would have the knowledge of identifying and subsequently fixing, similar manifestations of these problems in their code.

                Chirantan Mitra is better known as Chiku. He is a developer at ThoughtWorks with experience in working on complex domains mostly involving Ruby or C#. He has been programming since the age of nine - he loved it back then and still does so now. He conveniently forgets his Twitter handle from time to time but remembers to <a href="https://github.com/chiku">share his code</a>.<br /><br />
                                Habibullah Pagarkar is almost always known as Habib. He juggles various roles at ThoughtWorks but is primarily a software engineer. He abhors waste and loves efficiency - not just in software. In his spare time he can be found cycling along Bangalore's Old Airport Road. He very rarely updates his <a href="http://www.cs.jhu.edu/~habib">website</a> but regularly tweets as <a href="http://www.twitter.com/mhabibp">@mhabibp</a>

                :talk => "Test Load Balancer: rocket booster for your build"
              </div>
              <div class="talk_description">
                <a href="http://test-load-balancer.github.com/">Test Load Balancer (TLB)</a> is a tool that can automatically partition tests into multiple subsets each one of which can be executed in parallel. The execution can happen on different physical/virtual machines or on the same machine as different processes or threads. More the partitions, lesser are the number of tests executed on each one, and since all of the partitions start at the same time(and finish almost at the same time) overall test-execution time gets divided by the number of partitions you make. Test-running is by far the longest step in most(if not all) builds, and cutting down test-running time speeds up the build and hence the feedback loop. TLB can be used for any kind of test-suite - unit, integration or functional tests.<br />
                <br />
                In addition to balancing, TLB does other interesting things like re-order tests within a subset(set of tests that run on a partition) before they are executed. For instance, it re-arranges tests to execute failing ones(that failed in previous build) first, hence ensuring early feedback.<br />
                <br />
                Most build servers(like Hudson, Go, TeamCity, Bamboo etc.) and even tools like capistrano/cluster-ssh provide parallel execution capability(capability to execute command(s) on different machines at the same time). However, parallelization of tests needs a tool that can decide what tests need to be run in each such parallely running process across machines. This is where TLB comes in.<br />
                <br />
                This talk will introduce the audience to TLB concepts and include a demo of using TLB to partition RSpec and Test::Unit suites. It'll also includes a case-study on how TLB helped cut build time from approximately 70 minutes to 11 minutes(which can of-course be further reduced) just by throwing more hardware at it.

              </div>
              <div class="talk_description">
                By personal experience, while transitioning from the world of Java to the world of Ruby, I felt great pain and agony, whenever I read statements like "Everything in Ruby is an object; classes themselves are objects". It took me, more than a while to get it all right. Am of the belief that the experience is same for many who transitioned to the Ruby platform. If you didn't experience this - lucky you! My reason for this experience that I had undergone, is that during early days of learning Ruby I felt that the Ruby Object Model is some advanced topic as it is comes under Ruby Meta-programming, and that I can do away with it until I'm more than an intermediate level Ruby developer. In reality though, any decent programming in Ruby meant understanding rightly - the Ruby Object Model. Understanding Ruby Object Model, helps not just in learning Meta-programming, but also improves code design with enriched knowledge and appreciations of the object model.<br /><br />
                    In my presentation, I intend to talk about the Ruby Object Model, elaborating on the concepts of visualizing classes and objects in Ruby, how they are different from Java, method look-ups in Ruby, class/static methods in Java/C# vs. the ones in Ruby, mixins over inheritence and composition etc. All these concepts will be communicated by means of code snippets and no-nonsense visuals (object-like diagrams).

                The JRuby team has been proclaiming JRuby on Rails as the cure to
                legacy Java blues for years but we've been lacking a compelling
                example that developers can use as a guideline for how to achieve
                this. We'll discuss and demonstrate three possible approaches,
                allowing for a minimal, medium, and large amount of reorganization to
                an existing project. Each approach will build upon the previous one,
                showing developers how they can take an incremental approach to
                introducing Ruby into an existing Java environment to increase
                development productivity.

              <div class="talk_description">
                jQuery is great for websites that need simple AJAX interactions and
                some effects (example Youtube/Flickr). However, if you want to build
                complex single page web applications like Gmail or Mobile Me, you need
                something more than jQuery. Keeping track of DOM elements to be
                updated in response to a particular action or result of an ajax query
                can become overwhelming very fast.<br /><br />

                Frameworks like Sproutcore, Cappuccino and Backbone.js provide
                structure to your javascript code. Backbone supplies structure to
                JavaScript-heavy applications by providing models with key-value
                binding and custom events, collections with a rich API of enumerable
                functions and views with declarative event handling.<br /><br />

A pattern we've observed in the latter situation is that a surprising number of times the argument is that "Why shouldn't I use language feature X to achieve objective Y- after all, the language supports X."<br /><br />

                In this talk we will cover various features provided by Ruby that, while awesome, should be used with caution. We will cover:<br /><br />

<ol class="bullet_points_talk_description">
                <li>The appropriate situation where a certain language construct should be used</li>
                <li>Situations where I've seen it misused</li>
                <li>The underlying principles that will guide you as to how to use it best.</li>
                <li>Alternative approaches that achieve the same effect</li>
                </ol>
                <br />

                Here's a brief list of language constructs we will cover: <br /><br />

                CoffeeScript is a great way to write javascript. It provides many
                abstractions that simplify the language, and a few syntax niceties
                that make it much less noisy than pure javascript.

                We’ll cover the basic syntax and how it differs from regular
                javascript, see some examples, and see how you can integrate it with
                Backbone.js to build robust MVC applications on the client side.

                Moreover, Rails 3.1 will ship with CoffeeScript by default, so this is
                a great time to get up to speed with it!

Since that time Mark has grown the development team at Castle Rock from 10 developers to 100 developers spanning 2 continents and 3 cities. The expansion has provided Castle Rock with the capacity to deliver both web applications (primarily .NET and Ruby on Rails) and mobile applications (primarily iOS and Android) to their growing customer base.<br /><br />
              Mark has been involved in mobile application development since before the dawn of the iPhone (in 2007) and has built the technology group at Castle Rock with mobile in mind. This is most evident in Castle Rocks mobile educational platform, SOLARO which launched with the iPad App Store this spring. SOLARO gives students access to a variety of standards-aligned supplemental resources through their choice of iOS, Android or Web apps.<br /><br />
              From OSX Dashboard Widgets to Industrial Process Control apps on WinMo, Mark has written code that runs on just about everything. His 15 years of software development experience and passion for building usable software is apparent in everything he does.<br /><br />

Ruby provides wonderfully accessible libraries to dive into compiler construction and the talk will focus on one of them: Treetop<br /><br />

                The talk will detail the construction of a simple filter language and using Treetop to parse grammar and interpret it, and then make it working. Treetop makes it very simple and intuitive to add new operators and new syntax, and the talk will walk through the addition of a new operator to the language. Towards the end, a simple cross-compiler will be discussed that translates our filter language into fast C.

                This talk would highlight the story of an Enterprise that adopted Ruby
                and Rails as its preferred technology for development in its quest of
                being Agile over the last four years. This step brought in a makeover
                in the way the development team functioned as well as the way the
                operations performed their job.<br /><br />
                I would love to share my experience when the development teams
                embraced Ruby and Rails. The dev teams imbibed and personified the DRY
                concept by building and institutionalizing enterprise wide gems and
                plug-ins such as LDAP Management, Single Sign On, Authentication and
                Authorization, Usage Tracking. The team created an app that allows
                bootstrapping a new ruby application with enterprise specific
                plug-ins, configuring Continuous Integration, and deploying to shared
                dev box in minutes. The dev teams got hooked on to the engineering
                practices such as automation testing, automated deployments utilizing
                the power of Rails framework and components such as Capistrano. The
                adoption of Ruby truly changed the thinking and functioning of the dev
                teams.<br /><br />
                I would also like to talk about how the operations teams opened their
                world to open source, specifically Ruby. After the initial resistance
                to open source, the Ops teams now love the Ruby and Rails
                infrastructure. Ruby gives them immense opportunity to maximize
                automation, monitoring and management of applications. The Ops team is
                now inching towards one click deployment of applications across
                environments, surely a dream come true in any enterprise.

                The Ruby ecosystem is pretty awesome when it comes to developing or
                consuming HTTP APIs. On the publishing front, the Rails framework is
                an attractive option because it supports publishing what are popularly
                (but inaccurately) referred to as 'RESTful' APIs quickly and
                effortlessly. On the consumer side, the Ruby ecosystem provides
                several very fluent and powerful libraries that make it easy to
                consume HTTP based APIs.<br /><br />

                Since a significant proportion of projects today require that APIs be
                both published and consumed, many of them wind up choosing Ruby as a
                platform for the reasons mentioned above. This talk is targeted at
                folks that are currently on such projects, or anticipate being on such
                projects in the future.<br /><br />

                used Rails 1.0. He has also spent a few years working on .Net, Java
                and Ruby projects at ThoughtWorks. He has spent the last year helping
                co-found <a href="http://c42.in">C42 Engineering</a>, a Ruby consultancy based out of Bangalore
                where he now works as a developer.<br /><br />

                Paginate</a> and <a href="http://github.com/c42/goldberg">Goldberg</a> projects and has contributed features and
                bug fixes to the RSpec project.<br/ ><br />
                  Niranjan has spent five years writing code for a living. He started out at Infosys, wised up to the game and moved on to ThoughtWorks where he spent two pleasant years first working on Java and then on Ruby. All told, he's spent about three years building Ruby and Rails projects thus far. He left ThoughtWorks early in 2010 to co-found C42 Engineering, a boutique Ruby and Rails services firm based out of Bangalore.<br /><br />
